#Discord.py Bot Template, by Zennara#8377
#This template is a compilation of code to make it easier to design your own Discord.py Bot
#I made this for my own use, but don't care who uses it, but please credit me if someone asks :)

#imports
import discord #api
import os #for virtual environment secrets on replit
import keep_alive #this keeps our bot alive from the keep_alive.py file
import asyncio #not needed unless creating loop tasks etc (you'll run into it)
import json #to write db to a json file
import requests #to check discord api for limits/bans
from replit import db #database storage

#api limit checker
r = requests.head(url="https://discord.com/api/v1")
try:
  print(f"You are being Rate Limited : {int(r.headers['Retry-After']) / 60} minutes left")
except:
  print("No rate limit")

#declare client
intents = discord.Intents.all() #declare what Intents you use, these will be checked in the Discord dev portal
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

keep_alive.keep_alive() 
#keep the bot running after the window closes, use UptimeRobot to ping the website at least every <60min. to prevent the website from going to sleep, turning off the bot

#run bot
#Add a secret environment variable named TOKEN in replit (lock icon on left sidebar)
client.run(os.environ.get("TOKEN"))
