#Discord.py Bot Template, by Zennara#8377
#This template is a compilation of code to make it easier to design your own Discord.py Bot
#I made this for my own use, but don't care who uses it, but please credit me if someone asks :)

#imports
import discord #api
import os #for virtual environment secrets on replit
import keep_alive #this keeps our bot alive from the keep_alive.py file
import asyncio #not needed unless creating loop tasks etc (you'll run into it)
import json #to write db to a json file
import requests #to check discord api for limits/bans
from replit import db #database storage
